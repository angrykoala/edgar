>The programming language of your <s>dreams</s> nightmares

Like a tale from [Edgar Allan Poe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe) this programming language will come to haunt your dreams and thoughts


Edgar is a superset of JavaScript, that is designed to transpile to the later, however, instead of adding or improving the core language (like any sensible superset of JavaScript would do) it adds non-recommended features that were missing in JS:

- [x] Operator overloading
- [ ] Structs
- [ ] GOTO statements
